# Multi-Object-Tracking
Repository for the course "Multi-Object Tracking for Automotive Systems" at EDX Chalmers University of Technology

## Home-Assignment 01 (HA01) - Single-Object Tracking in Clutter
Implementation of the following algorithms:
- [x] Nearest Neighbors Filter (NN)
- [x] Probabilistic Data Association Filter (PDA)
- [x] Gaussian Sum Filter (GSF)

The main class is located at [HA01/singleobjectracker.m](./HA01/singleobjectracker.m)
Simulations can be done using either [HA01/main.m](./HA01/main.m) or [HA01/simulation1_m.slx](./HA01/simulation1_m.m)

## Home-Assignment 02 (HA02) - Tracking n Objects in Clutter
Implementation of the following algorithms:
- [x] Global Nearest Neighbors Filter (GNN)
- [x] Joint Probabilistic Data Association Filter (JPDA)
- [ ] Track-oriented Multiple Hypothesis Tracker (MHT)

The main class is located at [HA02/n_objectracker.m](./HA02/n_objectracker.m)
Simulations can be done using either [HA02/main.m](./HA02/main.m) or [HA02/simulation2_m.m](./HA02/simulation2_m.m)
